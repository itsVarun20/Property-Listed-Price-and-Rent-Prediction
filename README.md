Project Domain: Real Estate Analytics

This repository contains the dataset, code, and web application for predicting property listed prices and rental values in the United States using machine learning algorithms.

## Overview

This project aims to develop a web application that predicts property prices and rental values based on various features using machine learning. The application leverages multiple algorithms to analyze key property characteristics such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, total area, price per sq.ft, and location to provide accurate estimates for both sale and rental prices.

Dataset: The dataset used in this project is "United States House Listings: Zillow Extract 2023" from Kaggle, containing a diverse snapshot of housing characteristics across various U.S. states, cities, and neighbourhoods. URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/febinphilips/us-house-listings-2023
